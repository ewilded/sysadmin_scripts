         The file of stored file properties (rkhunter.dat) does not exist, and should be created. To do this type in 'rkhunter --propupd'.
Warning: WARNING! It is the users responsibility to ensure that when the '--propupd' option
         is used, all the files on their system are known to be genuine, and installed from a
         reliable source. The rkhunter '--check' option will compare the current file properties
         against previously stored values, and report if any values differ. However, rkhunter
         cannot determine what has caused the change, that is for the user to do.
